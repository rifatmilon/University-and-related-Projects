## 🔬 An Interpretable Enhanced VGG16-Based Transfer Learning Model for Improved Skin Cancer Classification

**Status:** Ongoing  
**Institution:** University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh (ULAB)  
**Research Duration:** July 16, 2024 – April 30, 2025  

- Developed a deep learning–based binary classifier for skin cancer using transfer learning with VGG16 as the base model.  
- Optimized model performance through fine-tuning and advanced optimization techniques, and applied Explainable AI (Grad-CAM) for interpretable predictions.  
- Built a real-time, accessible screening web application using Flux.
