            We blood bank collects, separates, tests and stores blood until a patient needs it. If you have donated blood before, you have 
            been part of the blood banking process.<br><br>The first blood bank in the United States was established in 1937 by Dr. Bernard Fantus 
            at Cook County Hospital in Chicago. At the time, it was not possible to store blood for more than a few days. Most transfusions were 
            person-to-person, a dangerous process which made it hard to find donors.<br><br>Hoping to solve this problem, Dr. Fantus began 
            experimenting with ways to safely store blood. Initially called the Blood Preservation Laboratory, he changed the name to “blood bank” 
            which was less likely to scare away potential donors. The ability to collect and store blood for an extended period of time 
            revolutionized how doctors treated patients. Donating blood was no longer a high-risk process and patients in need had access to blood 
            they needed for survival.

        <p id="id2"><font size="5">
            Over the years, blood banking has helped save countless lives. Today, about 13.6 million units of blood are donated per year. About 36,000 
            units of blood are needed each day. Thanks to advances in medical technology, blood banks can safely store blood donations, and process 
            and screen blood to ensure safety for all.

        <p id="id2"><font size="6">What Happens to Blood in a Blood Bank?</font></p>
        <p id="id2"><font size="5">
            The first step in the blood banking process is collection. Most blood banks, including the American Red Cross, rely on volunteer blood 
            donors. During a typical blood donation, about 1 pint of blood is collected, along with a few small tubes for testing. The tubes and 
            donation are labeled with donor information and sent off for processing and testing.<br><br>Next, the donated blood is taken to the 
            processing center. Whole blood is usually centrifuged, which separates it into its many components that patients may need: red blood 
            cells, platelets and plasma. White blood cells are removed from the blood to minimize the chance of a reaction in the recipient.<br><br>
            While the donation is being processed, the blood test tubes are sent out for screening. At the American Red Cross, this includes testing 
            for diseases such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV and West Nile Virus. If any of the tests are positive, the donor will be notified and 
            the blood will not be used. During the testing stage, the blood is also typed for ABO groups and Rh factor.<br><br>Once the blood is 
            screened and processed, it is stored up to 42 days or until it is needed. A blood bank ensures that hospitals have a safe, reliable 
            blood supply for patients in need. You can help meet supply demands by scheduling your donation today. Your donation may even help save 
            more than one life.
